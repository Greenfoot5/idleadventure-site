### ✨ New ✨
Added an Artifact Selector popup when discovering a new artifact!
You'll now be given a choice of 3 random artifacts to pick from.
The current UI is a first version—expect improvements in future updates!

### Fixes
- Fixed an issue where artifact level-up prices increased incorrectly in later worlds.
