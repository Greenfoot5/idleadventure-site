## 🚀 Major Milestone: MVP Release! 🚀

1. We’ve officially hit a big one — **the base gameplay loop is complete!** 🎉
2. From this point forward, we’ll be building **new features** and **expanding the existing systems** on top of this foundation.
3. Thanks so much for being here with us — we couldn’t have done it without you. 💚

- This is a __mandatory update__, and your game __will restart from the beginning__.
- Progress will reset as we roll out the rebalanced and finalized experience.
