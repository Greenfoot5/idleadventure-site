0.1.0 - MVP is finally here!

🚀 Major Milestone: MVP Release! 🚀

We’ve officially hit a big one — the base gameplay loop is complete! 🎉 From this point forward, we’ll be building new features and expanding the existing systems on top of this foundation.
Thanks so much for being here with us — we couldn’t have done it without you. 💚

This is a mandatory update, and your game will restart from the beginning. Progress will reset as we roll out the rebalanced and finalized experience.
